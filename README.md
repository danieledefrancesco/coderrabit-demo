# Spring Challenge

Extend the complete Advance challenge with the following feature:
- We want to store the information of the drivers of the trips.

Each trip will have at least one driver, but may have an additional driver.

Each driver will have the following properties:
- Id (autogenerated unique identifier)
- Name
- Last name
- Date of birth
- Driving license
- Citizenship

We must ensure that all the drivers have the minimum legal age to drive the vehicle. The minimum age will be different for each vehicle type:
- Pullman: 21 years
- Car: 18 years
- Scooter: 16 years
- Bike: No minimum age

Must-have:
- Use spring boot
- Refactor the code to use spring features: autoconfiguration, injection, ....
- Persist all the information in a PostgreSQL database (use docker compose)
- Create a custom annotations to the validations

The project should have a good test coverage that allows people to change pieces of code without being afraid to introduce/reintroduce bugs. Use the Mockito library where possible
